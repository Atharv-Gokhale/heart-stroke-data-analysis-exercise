# Heart stroke data analysis exercise
In this exercise, I analysed a heart stroke related dataset that is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

I used a Jupyter Notebook for working with the data using Python. I used Pandas DataFrames for handling the data and Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating data visualizations.

Check the Jupyter Notebook [here](heart-stroke-data-analysis-exercise.ipynb) for details.
